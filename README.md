This project analyzes a large mutual fund dataset to identify top-performing, low-risk mutual fund schemes by applying data cleaning, exploratory analysis, normalization, and custom scoring using Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn) and Excel, and presents insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes key investment metrics, trends, and comparative performance to support data-driven decision-making.
